#' @title Run the simulation
#' @description
#' Run the simulation for some time given some parameters. This currently
#' returns a dataframe with the number of individuals in each state at each
#' timestep.
#'
#' The resulting dataframe contains the following columns:
#'
#'  * timestep: the timestep for the row
#'  * infectivity: the infectivity from humans towards mosquitoes
#'  * FOIM: the force of infection towards mosquitoes (per species)
#'  * mu: the death rate of adult mosquitoes (per species)
#'  * EIR: the Entomological Inoculation Rate (per timestep, per species, over 
#'  the whole population)
#'  * n_bitten: number of humans bitten by an infectious mosquito
#'  * n_treated: number of humans treated for clinical or severe malaria this timestep
#'  * n_infections: number of humans who get an asymptomatic, clinical or severe malaria this timestep
#'  * natural_deaths: number of humans who die from aging
#'  * S_count: number of humans who are Susceptible
#'  * A_count: number of humans who are Asymptomatic
#'  * D_count: number of humans who have the clinical malaria
#'  * U_count: number of subpatent infections in humans
#'  * Tr_count: number of infections being treated in humans
#'  * ica_mean: the mean acquired immunity to clinical infection over the population of humans
#'  * icm_mean: the mean maternal immunity to clinical infection over the population of humans
#'  * ib_mean: the mean blood immunity to all infection over the population of humans
#'  * id_mean: the mean immunity from detection through microscopy over the population of humans
#'  * n: number of humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep. This
#' defaults to n_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
#' prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * n_detect: number of humans with an infection detectable by microscopy between an inclusive age range at this timestep. This
#' defaults to n_detect_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
#' prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * p_detect: the sum of probabilities of detection by microscopy between an
#' inclusive age range at this timestep. This
#' defaults to p_detect_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
#' prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * n_severe: number of humans with a severe infection between an inclusive
#' age range at this timestep. Age ranges can be set with
#' severe_prevalence_rendering_min_ages and severe_prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * n_inc: number of new infections for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
#' incidence columns can be set with
#' incidence_rendering_min_ages and incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * p_inc: sum of probabilities of infection for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
#' incidence columns can be set with
#' incidence_rendering_min_ages and incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * n_inc_clinical: number of new clinical infections for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep. 
#' clinical incidence columns can be set with
#' clinical_incidence_rendering_min_ages and clinical_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * p_inc_clinical: sub of probabilities of clinical infection for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep. 
#' clinical incidence columns can be set with
#' clinical_incidence_rendering_min_ages and clinical_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * n_inc_severe: number of new severe infections for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
#' severe incidence columns can be set with
#' severe_incidence_rendering_min_ages and severe_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * p_inc_severe: the sum of probabilities of severe infection for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
#' severe incidence columns can be set with
#' severe_incidence_rendering_min_ages and severe_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
#'  * severe_deaths: number of deaths due to severe malaria. severe_enabled must be
#' set to TRUE
#'  * E_count: number of mosquitoes in the early larval stage (per species)
#'  * L_count: number of mosquitoes in the late larval stage (per species)
#'  * P_count: number of mosquitoes in the pupal stage (per species)
#'  * Sm_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are Susceptible (per
#'  species)
#'  * Pm_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are incubating (per
#'  species)
#'  * Im_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are infectious (per
#'  species)
#'  * rate_D_A: rate that humans transition from clinical disease to
#' asymptomatic
#'  * rate_A_U: rate that humans transition from asymptomatic to
#' subpatent
#'  * rate_U_S: rate that humans transition from subpatent to
#' susceptible
#'  * mosquito_deaths: number of adult female mosquitoes who die this timestep
