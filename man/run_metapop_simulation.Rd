run_metapop_simulation(
  timesteps,
  parameters,
  correlations = NULL,
  mixing_tt,

  import_mixing,
  p_captured_tt,

}
\arguments{
\item{timesteps}{the number of timesteps to run the simulation for (in days)}

\item{parameters}{a list of model parameter lists for each population}

\item{correlations}{a list of correlation parameters for each population
(default: NULL)}

\item{mixing_tt}{a vector of time steps for each mixing matrix}

\item{export_mixing}{a list of matrices of coefficients for exportation of infectivity.
Rows = origin sites, columns = destinations. Each matrix element
describes the mixing pattern from destination to origin. Each matrix element must
be between 0 and 1. Each matrix is activated at the corresponding timestep in mixing_tt}

\item{import_mixing}{a list of matrices of coefficients for importation of
infectivity.}

\item{p_captured_tt}{a vector of time steps for each p_captured matrix}

\item{p_captured}{a list of matrices representing the probability that
travel between sites is intervened by a test and treat border check.
Dimensions are the same as for \code{export_mixing}}

\item{p_success}{the probability that an individual who has tested positive
(through an RDT) successfully clears their infection through treatment}
}
\value{
a list of dataframe of model outputs as in run_simulation
