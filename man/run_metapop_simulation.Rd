\usage{
run_metapop_simulation(
  timesteps,
  parameters,
  correlations = NULL,
  mixing_tt,
  mixing
)
}
\arguments{
\item{timesteps}{the number of timesteps to run the simulation for (in days)}

\item{parameters}{a list of model parameter lists for each population}

\item{correlations}{a list of correlation parameters for each population
(default: NULL)}

\item{mixing_tt}{a vector of time steps for each mixing matrix}

\item{mixing}{a list of matrices of mixing coefficients for infectivity towards
mosquitoes. Rows = origin sites, columns = destinations. Each matrix element
describes the mixing pattern from destination to origin. Each matrix element must
be between 0 and 1. Each matrix is activated at the corresponding timestep in mixing_tt}
