\title{Run the simulation in a resumable way}
\usage{
run_resumable_simulation(
  timesteps,
  parameters = NULL,
  correlations = NULL,
  initial_state = NULL,
  restore_random_state = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{timesteps}{the timestep at which to stop the simulation}

\item{parameters}{a named list of parameters to use}

\item{correlations}{correlation parameters}

\item{initial_state}{the state from which the simulation is resumed}

\item{restore_random_state}{if TRUE, restore the random number generator's state from the checkpoint.}
}
\value{
a list with two entries, one for the dataframe of results and one for the final
simulation state.
}
\description{
this function accepts an initial simulation state as an argument, and returns the
final state after running all of its timesteps. This allows one run to be resumed, possibly
having changed some of the parameters.
}
