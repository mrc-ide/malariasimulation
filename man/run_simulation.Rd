\description{
Run the simulation for some time given some parameters. This currently
returns a dataframe with the number of individuals in each state at each
timestep.

The resulting dataframe contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item timestep: the timestep for the row
\item infectivity: the infectivity from humans towards mosquitoes
\item FOIM: the force of infection towards mosquitoes (per species)
\item mu: the death rate of adult mosquitoes (per species)
\item EIR: the Entomological Inoculation Rate (per timestep, per species, over
the whole population)
\item n_bitten: number of humans bitten by an infectious mosquito
\item n_treated: number of humans treated for clinical or severe malaria this timestep
\item n_infections: number of humans who get an asymptomatic, clinical or severe malaria this timestep
\item natural_deaths: number of humans who die from aging
\item S_count: number of humans who are Susceptible
\item A_count: number of humans who are Asymptomatic
\item D_count: number of humans who have the clinical malaria
\item U_count: number of subpatent infections in humans
\item Tr_count: number of detectable infections being treated in humans
\item ica_mean: the mean acquired immunity to clinical infection over the population of humans
\item icm_mean: the mean maternal immunity to clinical infection over the population of humans
\item ib_mean: the mean blood immunity to all infection over the population of humans
\item id_mean: the mean immunity from detection through microscopy over the population of humans
\item n: number of humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep. This
defaults to n_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item n_detect: number of humans with an infection detectable by microscopy between an inclusive age range at this timestep. This
defaults to n_detect_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item p_detect: the sum of probabilities of detection by microscopy between an
inclusive age range at this timestep. This
defaults to p_detect_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item n_severe: number of humans with a severe infection between an inclusive
age range at this timestep. Age ranges can be set with
severe_prevalence_rendering_min_ages and severe_prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item n_inc: number of new infections for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
incidence columns can be set with
incidence_rendering_min_ages and incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item p_inc: sum of probabilities of infection for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
incidence columns can be set with
incidence_rendering_min_ages and incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item n_inc_clinical: number of new clinical infections for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
clinical incidence columns can be set with
clinical_incidence_rendering_min_ages and clinical_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item p_inc_clinical: sub of probabilities of clinical infection for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
clinical incidence columns can be set with
clinical_incidence_rendering_min_ages and clinical_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item n_inc_severe: number of new severe infections for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
severe incidence columns can be set with
severe_incidence_rendering_min_ages and severe_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item p_inc_severe: the sum of probabilities of severe infection for humans between an inclusive age range at this timestep.
severe incidence columns can be set with
severe_incidence_rendering_min_ages and severe_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item E_count: number of mosquitoes in the early larval stage (per species)
\item L_count: number of mosquitoes in the late larval stage (per species)
\item P_count: number of mosquitoes in the pupal stage (per species)
\item Sm_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are Susceptible (per
species)
\item Pm_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are incubating (per
species)
\item Im_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are infectious (per
species)
\item rate_D_A: rate that humans transition from clinical disease to
asymptomatic
\item rate_A_U: rate that humans transition from asymptomatic to
subpatent
\item rate_U_S: rate that humans transition from subpatent to
susceptible
\item net_usage: the number people protected by a bed net
\item mosquito_deaths: number of adult female mosquitoes who die this timestep
\item n_drug_efficacy_failures: number of clinically treated individuals whose treatment failed due to drug efficacy
\item n_early_treatment_failure: number of clinically treated individuals who experienced early treatment failure
\item n_successfully_treated: number of clinically treated individuals who are treated successfully (includes individuals who experience slow parasite clearance)
\item n_slow_parasite_clearance: number of clinically treated individuals who experienced slow parasite clearance
