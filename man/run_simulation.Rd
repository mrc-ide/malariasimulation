\description{
Run the simulation for some time given some parameters. This currently
returns a dataframe with the number of individuals in each state at each
timestep.

The resulting dataframe contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item timestep: the timestep for the row
\item infectivity: the infectivity from humans towards mosquitoes
\item FOIM: the force of infection towards mosquitoes (per species)
\item mu: the death rate of adult mosquitoes (per species)
\item EIR: the Entomological Inoculation Rate (per timestep, per species, over
the whole population)
\item n_bitten: number of humans bitten by an infectious mosquito
\item n_treated: number of humans treated for clinical or severe malaria at this timestep
\item n_infections: number of humans who experience a malaria infection (p.v only: or hypnozoite relapse) at this timestep
\item n_new_bite_infections: number of humans who are experience a new malaria infection via mosquito bite at this timestep (p.v only)
\item n_relapses: number of humans who experience hypnozoite relapse leading to infection at this timestep (p.v only)
\item natural_deaths: number of humans who die from aging
\item S_count: number of humans who are Susceptible

defaults to n_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.

\item p_detect: the sum of probabilities of detection by microscopy between an
inclusive age range at this timestep. This
defaults to p_detect_730_3650. Other age ranges can be set with
prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
\item n_severe: number of humans with a severe infection between an inclusive
age range at this timestep. Age ranges can be set with
