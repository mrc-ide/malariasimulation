\description{
The model will distribute bed nets at \code{timesteps} to a random
sample of the entire human population. The sample size will be a proportion
of the human population taken from the corresponding \code{coverages}.
The sample \emph{can} contain humans who already have bed nets.

All of the sample "use" their bed nets on the timestep after they are
distributed. Incomplete usage is not part of this model.

If a human in the sample already has a bed net, their bed net will be replaced
by a new one.

Using the gamman parameter:

Bed nets will be randomly removed each timestep with a rate of \code{1 - exp(-1/gamman)}

Alternatively, the logistic retention parameters can be used. Retention time
is calculated using the logistic decay function:

l (time at which all nets fail) = half_life / sqrt(1 - k / (k - log(0.5)))
T (simulated time for individual failure) = l * sqrt( a / (1 + a ) ),  a = -log(U)/k

The structure for the bed net model is documented in the
S.I. of 10.1038/s41467-018-07357-w
