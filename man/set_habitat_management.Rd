\usage{
set_habitat_management(
  parameters,
  habitat_management_timesteps,
  lsm_new_eqm,
  lsm_rate_alpha,
  lsm_rate_beta
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{habitat_management_timesteps}{the timesteps at which to distribute lsm rounds}

\item{lsm_new_eqm}{controls the level of recruitment to the adult mosquito susceptible cohort;
Default = 1, this is no reduction, while 0 simulates mosquito elimination.
This must be a matrix of reduction probabilities for each species over time
with nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\item{lsm_rate_alpha}{a matrix for each species over timesteps
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species);
Default = -4, highly recommend restricting this between -6 and 5
The higher the value the longer it takes for lsm to have an impact}

\item{lsm_rate_beta}{a matrix for each species over timesteps
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species);
Default = 0.1, this together with lsm_rate_alpha = -4 will bring about the new equilibrium in about a month,
recommended range 0.5 (prolonged time until new equilibrium level of adult recruitment)
to 0.01 (very rapid decline in mosquito recruitment)
New equilibrium defined by lsm_new_eqm parameter estimate}
}
\description{
The model will simulate larval source management at
\code{timesteps} to the entire human population.
The impact will reduce adult mosquitoes recruited from pupae to the susceptible
cohort.
