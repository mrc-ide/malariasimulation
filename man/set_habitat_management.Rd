\usage{
set_habitat_management(
  parameters,
  timesteps,
  lsm_new_eqm,
  lsm_rate_alpha,
  lsm_rate_beta
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{timesteps}{the timesteps at which to distribute lsm rounds}

\item{lsm_new_eqm}{controls the level of recruitment to the adutl mosquito susceptible cohort; default = 1, this is no reduction, while 0 achieves a 50\% reduction and -1 acheives elimination.This must be a matrix of reduction probabilities for each species over time
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\item{lsm_rate_alpha}{a matrix of reduction probabilities for each species over time
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species); default = 6, highly recommend restricting this between 4 and 7}

\item{lsm_rate_beta}{a matrix of reduction probabilities for each species over time
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species); default = -0.2, this together with lsm_rate_alpha = 6 will bring about the new equilibrium in about a month,
recommended range -0.5 (about 1 week to new equilibrium) to -0.1 (about 2 months to new equilibrium)
New equilibrium defined by lsm_new_eqm parameter}

\description{
The model will simulate larval source management at
\code{timesteps} to the entire human population.
The impact will reduce adult mosquitoes recruited from pupae to the susceptible
cohort. This is controlled by 3 parameters,
lsm_new_eqm: this has to take a value between 1 and -1. If 1, there is no reduction, if 0 there is 50\% reduction, if -1 complete reduction.
This parameter controls the new equilibrium representing some fraction of the adult mosquitoes entering the susceptible cohort
lsm_rate_alpha and lsm_rate_beta: these two parameters determine the time until the new equilibrium is reached, the default parameters
result in a new equilibrium after about 1 month (30 days). Changing lsm_rate_beta to -.05 will speed up this to about 1 week.
