\description{
The model will simulate larval source habitat management at
\code{timesteps} to the entire human population.
The impact will reduce adult mosquitoes recruited from pupae to the susceptible
cohort.

The rapidity of the impact is captured by the lsm_factor function
by changing the parameters lsm_rate and deprec_param

The amount of impact in terms of reduced adult mosquito densities
that the habitat management has is determined by larvi_min which is
set to 1 as default when there is no impact.

Habitat management effects will be randomly removed each timestep with a rate of \code{1 - exp(-1/habitat_management_waning)}

The structure for the habitat model is documented in the
working draft Sherrard-Smith et al (larviciding in Kenya)
