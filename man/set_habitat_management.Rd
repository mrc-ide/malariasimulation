\usage{
set_habitat_management(
  parameters,
  timesteps,
  larvi_min,
  lsm_rate,
  deprec_param
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{timesteps}{the timesteps at which to distribute lsm rounds}

\item{larvi_min}{a matrix of reduction probabilities for each species over time
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\item{lsm_rate}{a matrix of reduction probabilities for each species over time
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\item{deprec_param}{a matrix of reduction probabilities for each species over time}
}
\description{
The model will simulate larval source habitat management at
\code{timesteps} to the entire human population.
The impact will reduce adult mosquitoes recruited from pupae to the susceptible
cohort.

The rapidity of the impact is captured by the lsm_factor function
by changing the parameters lsm_rate and deprec_param

The amount of impact in terms of reduced adult mosquito densities
that the habitat management has is determined by larvi_min which is
set to 1 as default when there is no impact.

The structure for the habitat model is documented in the
working draft Sherrard-Smith et al (larviciding in Kenya)
