\title{Parameterise a housing improvement strategy}
\usage{
set_housing(parameters, timesteps, coverages, phi_housing, rn_house)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{timesteps}{the timesteps at which to improve the house}

\item{coverages}{the proportion of the population who get a benefit from housing improvements}

\item{phi_housing}{a parameter to potentially increase outdoor biting, default 1}

\item{rn_house}{matrix of repellence parameters, will increase repelled, decrease indoor bites
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}
}
\description{
The model will simulate improved housing at \code{timesteps} to a random
sample of the entire human population. The sample size will be a proportion
of the human population taken from the corresponding \code{coverages}.
The sample \emph{can} contain humans who have already benefited from housing.

If a human in the sample lives in a house that has been improved to reduce
mosquito entry, the efficacy of the
housing improvement will be high - as determined by the parameter rn_house

The structure for the housing model will be documented in a publication
Sherrard-Smith et al in prep
