With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\item{rh}{a matrix of repelling probabilities for each species over time
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\description{
The model will simulate improved housing at \code{timesteps} to a random
sample of the entire human population. The sample size will be a proportion
of the human population taken from the corresponding \code{coverages}.
The sample \emph{can} contain humans who have already benefited from housing.

If a human in the sample lives in a house that has been improved to reduce
mosquito entry, the efficacy of the
housing improvement will be high - as determined by the parameter rn_house

The structure for the housing model will be documented in a publication
Sherrard-Smith et al in prep
