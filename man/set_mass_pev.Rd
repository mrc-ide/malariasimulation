\usage{
set_mass_pev(
  parameters,
  profile,
  timesteps,
  coverages,
  min_ages,
  max_ages,
  min_wait,
  booster_spacing,
  booster_coverage,
  booster_profile
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{profile}{a list of details for the vaccine profile, create with \code{create_pev_profile}}

\item{timesteps}{a vector of timesteps for each round of vaccinations}

\item{coverages}{the coverage for each round of vaccinations}

\item{min_ages}{for the target population, inclusive (in timesteps)}

\item{max_ages}{for the target population, inclusive (in timesteps)}

\item{min_wait}{the minimum acceptable time since the last vaccination (in timesteps);
When using both set_mass_pev and set_pev_epi, this represents the minimum
time between an individual being vaccinated under one scheme and vaccinated under another.}

\item{booster_spacing}{the timesteps (following the final primary dose) at which booster vaccinations are administered}

\item{booster_coverage}{a matrix of coverages (timesteps x boosters) specifying the proportion the previously vaccinated population to continue receiving booster doses. The rows of the matrix must be the same size as \code{timesteps}. The columns of the matrix must be the same size as \code{booster_spacing}.}

\item{booster_profile}{list of lists representing each booster profile, the outer list must be the same length as \code{booster_spacing}. Create vaccine profiles with \code{create_pev_profile}}
}
\description{
distribute pre-erythrocytic vaccine to a population in an age range.
Efficacy will take effect after the last dose
