\title{Parameterise the parasite species to use in the model}
\usage{
set_parasite(parameters, parasite)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{the model parameters}

\item{parasite}{parasite species name: "falciparum" or "vivax"}
}
\description{
The \code{get_parameters} function assumes as default that Plasmodium falciparum is being modelled (parasite = "falciparum").
\code{set_parasite} takes the P. falciparum parameter set and alters it to reflect vivax parameters when the parasite = "vivax" argument is given.
If parasite = "falciparum" is given, it simply returns the given parameter set.
The remaining documentation describes the changes that get made when "vivax" is selected.
