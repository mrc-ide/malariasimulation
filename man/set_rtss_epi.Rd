\usage{
set_rtss_epi(
  parameters,
  start,
  end,
  coverage,
  age,
  min_wait,
  boosters,
  booster_coverage,
  seasonal_boosters = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{start}{timestep to turn on epi vaccination}

\item{end}{timestep to turn off epi vaccination}

\item{coverage}{the coverage for the starter doses}

\item{age}{for the target population, (in timesteps)}

\item{min_wait}{the minimum acceptable time since the last vaccination (in
timesteps); When seasonal_boosters = TRUE, this represents the minimum time
between an individual receiving the final dose and the first booster. When using
both set_mass_rtss and set_rtss_epi, this represents the minimum time between
an individual being vaccinated under one scheme and vaccinated under another.}

\item{boosters}{the timesteps (following the final dose) at which booster vaccinations are administered}

\item{booster_coverage}{the proportion of the vaccinated population who will
receive each booster vaccine}

\item{seasonal_boosters}{logical, if TRUE the first booster timestep is
relative to the start of the year, otherwise they are relative to the last dose}
}
\description{
distribute RTS,S vaccine when an individual becomes a certain
age. Efficacy will take effect after the last dose
}
