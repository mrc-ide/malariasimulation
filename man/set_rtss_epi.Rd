  coverage,

}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{start}{timestep to turn on epi vaccination}

\item{end}{timestep to turn off epi vaccination}

\item{coverage}{the coverage for the starter doses}

\item{age}{for the target population, (in timesteps)}

\item{min_wait}{the minimum acceptable time since the last vaccination (in
timesteps); This includes seasonal boosters and vaccinations between EPI and mass
strategies}

\item{boosters}{the timesteps (following the final dose) at which booster vaccinations are administered}

\item{booster_coverage}{the proportion of the vaccinated population who will
receive each booster vaccine}

\item{seasonal_boosters}{logical, if TRUE the first booster timestep is
relative to the start of the year, otherwise they are relative to the last dose}
}
\description{
distribute RTS,S vaccine when an individual becomes a certain
age. Efficacy will take effect after the last dose
