\description{
The model will apply indoor spraying at \code{timesteps} to a random
sample of the entire human population. The sample size will be a proportion
of the human population taken from the corresponding \code{coverages}.
The sample \emph{can} contain humans who have already benefited from spraying.

If a human in the sample lives in a sprayed house, the efficacy of the
spraying will be returned to the maximum.

The structure for the indoor residual spraying model is documented in the
S.I. of 10.1038/s41467-018-07357-w
